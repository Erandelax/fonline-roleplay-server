Welcome, travellers!

Name's Alexander, tho some know me as Erandelax or (specifically at FOnline) - Sjaman.

## Prehistory

If you're here, most likely you already know about [FOnline SDK](https://svn.fonline.ru/). Or, at least you might heared about such multiplayer games as [FOnline 2](https://fonline2.com/en/), [FOnline: Reloaded](https://www.fonline-reloaded.net/) or any other project usually listed at [eastern](https://fonline-status.ru/en/) or [western](https://fodev.net/status/) status trackers.

All of them are united by the fact that they represent the conversion of the [Fallout 2](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_2) put on rails of multiplayer game (world events, factions, etc)... And I didnâ€™t play much on any of them.

What I did play were the series of [heavy roleplaying](https://www.lotro.com/forums/showthread.php?507089) FOnline servers driven by Russian-speaking community concentrated around [FOnline: The New Future](http://tnf.net.ru/) project, which tend to arrange game sessions lasting from several weeks to several months from time to time for about eight years.

In most of them I participated as player, in few of the last ones - as game moderator and the latest - as a developer. Sadly, most of those sessions were built mainly around very (like, *very*) old TNF build taking place around the Ford Sutter with very few differences both in term of plot events & gaming mechanics. Not too much inspiring it is to play the same thing again and again since 2013 :)

Few really cool novelties were introduced in session-based done by [@Pigboss](https://github.com/This-is-Jojo), technical novelties (moving to 390/412 revision of FOnline SDK) at Paradise City centric sessions (@Pigboss, [@Azein](https://github.com/Azein)), lots of base mechanic variations of TNF build (@Mio, @Kriegwolf, new [Next Day](http://fonextday.ru/) formation, etc)... And that's it.

For more than five years.

So you can believe how excited I was when at last September [@VVish](https://github.com/orgs/fonline-long-journey/people/VVisher) invited me to participate in the [(Long Journey)](https://github.com/fonline-long-journey/) project. Sadly, theorem "if you don't start the game session after one month of the development" got confirmed... Again. So, at the December I quit and the project went into "frozen" state. Fortunately, unlike other game sessions, this build was originally planned as an open-source, so anyone can take it at the project [Github](https://github.com/fonline-long-journey) and carry on in any direction.

## Now
One of the reasons I quit was that I never really liked the idea of making the "game server/session". FOnline SDK is too far from acceptable for comfortable roleplaying (despite the fact that many will say that for this they need just a chat line) to have an idea like that.

So, what I really wanted all of this time was to develop a relatively clean-state FOnline Roleplaying SDK build which could replace that old TNF monster for anyone planning to start his own game session.

And of course, who am I fooling, most of all I want to check and proof viability of few own core mechanic concepts. Something just. *Really new*.

Not sure how much time it might take, tho.
