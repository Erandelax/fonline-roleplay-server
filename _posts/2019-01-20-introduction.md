  Who am I, what's FOnline and its roleplay servers.

Welcome, travellers!

Name's Alexander, tho some know me as Erandelax or (specifically at FOnline) - Sjaman.

## Prehistory

If you're here, most likely you already know about [FOnline SDK](https://svn.fonline.ru/). Or, at least you might heared about such multiplayer games as [FOnline 2](https://fonline2.com/en/), [FOnline: Reloaded](https://www.fonline-reloaded.net/) or any other project usually listed at [eastern](https://fonline-status.ru/en/) or [western](https://fodev.net/status/) status trackers.

All of them are united by the fact that they represent the conversion of the [Fallout 2](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_2) put on rails of multiplayer game (world events, factions, etc)... And I didnâ€™t play much on any of them.

What I did play were the series of [heavy roleplaying](https://www.lotro.com/forums/showthread.php?507089) FOnline servers driven by Russian-speaking community concentrated around [FOnline: The New Future](http://tnf.net.ru/) project, which tend to arrange game sessions lasting from several weeks to several months from time to time for about eight years.

In most of them I participated as player, in few of the last ones - as game moderator and the latest - as a developer. Sadly, most of those sessions were built mainly around very (like, *very*) old TNF build taking place around the Ford Sutter with very few differences both in term of plot events & gaming mechanics. Not too much inspiring it is to play the same thing again and again since 2013 :)

Few really cool novelties were introduced in session-based done by [@Pigboss](https://github.com/This-is-Jojo), technical novelties (moving to 390/412 revision of FOnline SDK) at Paradise City centric sessions (@Pigboss, [@Azein](https://github.com/Azein)), lots of base mechanic variations of TNF build (@Mio, @Kriegwolf, new [Next Day](http://fonextday.ru/) formation, etc)... And that's it.

For more than five years.

So you can believe how excited I was when at last September [@VVish](https://github.com/orgs/fonline-long-journey/people/VVisher) invited me to participate in the [(Long Journey)](https://github.com/fonline-long-journey/) project. Sadly, theorems "if you don't start the game session after one month of the development" + "every FOnline scripter burns out after a few months" got confirmed... Again. So, at the December I quit and the project went into "frozen" state. Fortunately, unlike other game sessions, this build was originally planned as an open-source, so anyone can take it at the project [Github](https://github.com/fonline-long-journey) and carry on in any direction.

## Now
One of the reasons I quit was that I never really liked the idea of making the "game server". FOnline SDK is too far from acceptable level for comfortable roleplaying (despite the fact that many will say that for this they need just a chat line) and I'm too far from being sure that I'd not quit the whole FOnliny thing halfway to join any devteams right now.

What I really want to do no is to develop a relatively clean-state FOnline Roleplaying SDK build which could replace that old TNF monster while being more RP-applicable than 476* TLA build, so that anyone could just take it, change some config values and maps and will be good to go.

And of course, who am I fooling, most of all I want to check and proof viability of few own core mechanics. Something just. *Really new*. And really fit to my own taste.

Just beware that it might take years or I'll just quit few month later.
