## Armor 

Each *armor set* item has its own health (condition), DT (damage threshold) and DR
(damage reduction). 

When u get hit wearing armor, all incoming damage is multiplied with damage 
reduction and then applied to armor' damage. Once armor health reaches zero,
armor breaks and provide protection no longer - as if u was not wearing it.

Whenever you need, armor might be repaired (it's a continious action from the
engineering skill line) using appropriate resources.

*Armor plates* are consumable items that require no repair skill for application
and are basically medpacks for armor (repair N' armor HP per use).

## Shields 

In the same time any item you are carrying in your hands (primarily, weapons) 
have a small change to consume all incoming damage. More weight & volume that
item have, higher the chance is. Only shots taken in front of you can be shielded.

Beware some weapons might explode when broken.

## Evasion 

Unlike ranged attacks, melee attacks have additional chance to be blocked using
*melee block* ability, given that u managed to activate it in time, as well as
can be evaded automatically given that your character have enough agility points.

## Close fight 

What's good about melee fight - melee attacks might neglect a part of damage
threshold of target' armor, also there are numerous active abilities that might 
disarm, creeple, immobilize, paralyze or knock out targets. Most of melee 
attacks and abilities that use actual melee weapons can be performed in
close-to-medium range (tho you shall need to throw out your weapon).

Successfull melee attack wont break you out of stealth and will not attract 
attention of nearby NPCs given that it was not performed in their clear sight.

## Close-to-mid fight combat 

Pistols, SMGs and shotguns are the most deadly weapons on this range. 

SMGs and shotguns allow you to flood the whole sector in front of you with fire.

Pistols provide much higher accuracy and much shorter eqipment time and are 
weapons of choice if not everyone if front of you are your enemies.

## Mid-to-ranged combat 

Rifles and automatic rifles take place here. 

Rifles are usually more accurate than automatic ones, but provide much less 
supression effects to targets. Equipment time for both is similar.

## Ranged combat 

Sniper rifles are the only kings here, however they also have the most impactful
field of view restriction.

## Field of View 

Every weapon has hipfire and aimed attack modes. Second one means you recieve a
significant bonus to accuracy, but your field of you suffers. For example, while
using sniper rifles in aimed mode you will have like 30-60 degree cone of FoV. 
Longer the range of application of your weapon class, higher is FoV restriction.

## Supression 

As it was told, every character has physical and mental health. Supression is an
effect caused mostly by automatic weapons that applies a huge amount of damage
to the last one. Fully supressed targets wont fight back, however more supression
you cause - higher you are in NPCs targeting list which, taking into account 
amount of noise you cause, might lead all the NPCs on the location to try killing
you prior to other targets. Use silenced weapons to neglect that.

## Bullets, laser or plasma 

Bullets cause piercing and crushing damage. Laser causes various blinding effects,
crushing, thermal and radiation damage (which varies from non lethal blinding guns
to heavy laser rifes causing explosions on hit). Plasma guns cause high AOE 
thermal damage and huge mental one on each hit. Flamethrowers are considered 
plasma weapons.

## Cover 

Regarding free targeting and everything written above, all firearms fights are
fast and unforgiving. Closer the range - harder it is to avoid being hit. 

However, there are some tricks that might help you to survive.

Every time you stand beside the large object it drastically reduces amount of 
incoming mental damage and highly reduces your change to get hit.

If you want to neglect all chances being hit, you can blindfire around the 
corners (with a high accuracy penalty).

In the same way, but just partially, ex-stealth (now crouching) ability also 
lowers the chance to get a random hit.

Crouching (ex-stealth ability) and laid down (fall front/back ability) targets are
not highlighted in targeting interface. Crouching targets have twice less chance
to be hit by a random bullet, fallen targets can not be randomly hit by a bullet
unless you have specifically aimed your gun to the body. Cover bonuses for both
are also higher.

## Explosives 

There is a five second cooldown between grenade activation and explosion.

Assault grenades cause small explosion damage on hit, but produce a high amount
of shotgun-like pellets being shot in all directions on explosion. If you try
to use it not out of corner, most likely you'll get hit.

Standart grenades and dynamite cause high AOE explosion damage on hit.

All explosives can be used as a trap.

Flash grenades have a chance to stun enemies and most probably will make anyone in
blast radius blind for a few real world minutes.

EMP grenates have a chance to instantly shut down robots and turrets, break 
electronic locks or laser/plasma weapons in hands of your enemies.

All explosives have a chance to destroy equipped items of enemies inside the blast
radius as well as break locks of all kinds.

Molotovs will cause fire.

Explosives caught in explosions or by fire might explode on themselves. The same
applies to explosives your character carries around in his inventory as well.

## Gas and fire 

Smoke grenades limit enemy FoV. 

Stun grenades produce gas that spreads around immobilyzing your targets.

Gas grenades product gas that cause chocking.

Radiation sources might spawn wandering radioactive clouds from time to time.

Fire is now a threat that can spread around just like the gas litting characters 
and items on fire. Large areas of fire produce unbreathable gas just like the gas
grenades.

Farther from the initial spawn point, less time gas clouds can live.

Gas that spread out in underground location does not fade on itself.

## Ammo recovery 

Plasma cells and firearm shells can be restored, but will consume additional 
resources for crafting.

Laser weapons use batteries that can be recharged at the nearest power source 
(which might consume resources to work).
